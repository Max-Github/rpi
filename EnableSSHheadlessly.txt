Ensure that ssh will run and allow connections. Here's how I did it:

a. Mount the second SD Card partition, the big one with the etc directory.

b. Create a file etc/SSHFLAG

c. Insert the following code into etc/rc.local just above the exit 0 line.

if [ -e /etc/SSHFLAG ]; then
  /usr/sbin/update-rc.d -f ssh defaults
  /bin/rm /etc/SSHFLAG
  /sbin/shutdown -r now
fi
